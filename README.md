# NConnected

## In this repository

This is a formalization project for $n$-connected spaces and $n$-connected maps, as a project for Bonn Lean Course WiSe 25/26. The code is contained in file `Basic.lean`.

In this project, we formalized the following topics:
- $n$-connected spaces;
- 0-connected is equivalent to (path-)connected;
- 1-connected is equivalent to simply connected;
- homotopy fibre and $n$-connected maps;
- 0-connected map is equivalent to induced map on 0-th homotopy groups being surjective.
